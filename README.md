Hi! I use GitHub because I am a programmer. That's it :/
I am not familiar with GitHub at all.

If anyone can help with connecting my GitHub CLI (Which, for all I know, might not be properly installed) to my GitHub account, that will be great!

I don't care about my contribution graph, but it's a great way to make you want to boost your activity.
