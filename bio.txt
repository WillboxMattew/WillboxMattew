===== BREIF BIO =====
PLEASE READ A WHOLE NUMBER OF PARAGRAPHS (it makes it more understandable)
(Sentences are all on seperate lines due to loss of word wrapping)

I was diagnosed with ASD in the 4th grade.
If you don't beleive that, too bad - so sad.
It's kind of weird not knowing what "most other people" would do, know, or naturally learn,
  but all that matters is how competent you are, not how competent you appear to be.

Well, what do I do in a pinch?
I try to stay fair (but some people, AKA common middle-school male children, have extreme deficiency of social decency, and I
  steer clear of them and keep them out of my social life)
You may have noticed the word 'common' in that last sentence; it's important.
You may also think, "that's pretty much everyone, " and there is truth to that, but all you need is 2 or 3 friends, and you're fine.

I don't really use exclamation points, and I don't really want to be bugged by that.
Also, FYI, I don't really care that I have ASD; if you didn't notice already, I went 5 years in school (not including prescool)
  without knowing I was neurodivergent; I don't want to be bugged by this.
